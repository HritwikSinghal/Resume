Homelab

- Stateless, Immutable, Declarative deployment of my Proxmox-based Homelab. Used Terraform and Nix for provisioning of containers, VMs & DNS in Cloudflare & firewall.
- Reduced gaming latency by **50%** from **120ms to 55ms**, by carefully optimizing & tuning the network & OS; made **Remote gaming** viable over a distance of 2000km.
- Improved **security** and **performance** by isolating network & automated traffic routing  of segregated networks through **VLANs** for different services.
- Created a comprehensive **documentation** for all homelab components and operational procedures/workings to ensure maintainability.
- **Official maintainer** of Filebrowser package in Nixpkgs.

Site Reliability Engineer with **3+ years** of experience in building & maintaining resilient, scalable infrastructure in production environments. I am a **dedicated**, self-driven **geek** with a passion for **Python**, **Linux** & **self-hosting** and a strong zeal for **open-source development**. I'd rather spend 4 hours writing a program to **automate** a task than spend 4 minutes doing it manually every day.


And... that was the end of my formal introduction. 

So who am i? 

I am someone who likes to code, be it for my career or for solutions to problems that i create! (why spend 6 minutes doing something by hand when you can spend 6 hours to automate it xD). But seriously, this habit made me significantly better engineer over the past years.

Couldn't find a program to download songs or upgrade the ones in my library? Just code it. (i like to own my content)

Too lazy to walk 10 steps to turn lights/fan on? Control it via Raspberry pi + Relay.

Frustrated about all the privacy invading crap in OEM android? Just build your own fork of Android and tinker with it. (Yep, i use forked AOSP to build my own rom and daily drive it, no more OEM BS).

These are just a handful of instances through which I learned coding. Don't believe me? Just have a look at my GitHub profile. I am a huge free software and OSS supporter, so all my work is open source. (it ain't much, but it's honest work)

You can always have a chat with me on Linux, Competitive coding and how computer systems work.

I have also began self-hosting recently to get into a privacy-focused life and have been hosting many services on my homelab (TerraNixLab) which are direct replacements for many big-tech products.

Some of them include llama.cpp (local LLM's), Nextcloud (Google/Microsoft workspace alt and CalDav/contacts server), Immich (Google photos alt), Forgejo (Github/Gitlab alt), SearX (search), Bookstack (for documentation of my TerraNixLab & Life). And the list is ever growing!

Sunshine + Moonlight are my connection to video game world (and a 2000km journey between me and my Gaming Rig!). My achievements are often short-lived, however, as I'm a connoisseur of the 'You Died' experience.

Apart from that, i love playing badminton, reading psychology books, trekking and a little bit of gaming. I have also been traveling solo for the past year and been loving it so far. Movies, Web-series aren't my cup of tea. (well expect for LOTR and mystery/thriller genre).

Oh, I am also an Astronomy nerd. If you can tell me what a nebula is without Googling, you're instantly my new best friend!

And... that's all folks!

Break

Well, emergencies don't knock on your door; they just barge in and announce, ‘Time for a reset!’ So, I've been rediscovering all the things I forgot I loved – like finally tackling that coding project I'd been putting off, leveling up in my favorite game, and tinkering with my homelab without feeling guilty about neglecting work. Consider it an unexpected system reboot for my well-being.
